# Statusphere

Statusphere is a communications application designed for friends and family, enabling users to check on each other's well-being through simple notifications. Unlike traditional location-based tracking apps, Statusphere focuses on asking and receiving responses regarding safety status. The application utilizes notifications to prompt users to confirm their safety status, which is then visually represented on a 3D globe rendered using OpenGL.

## Features

- **Safety Check Notifications**: Users receive periodic notifications prompting them to confirm their safety status.
- **Safety Status Updates**: Users can respond to notifications with an affirmation or negation of their safety.
- **Visual Representation**: The safety status of users is visually represented on a 3D globe rendered using OpenGL.
- **Family and Friend Groups**: Users can create and manage groups comprising friends and family members.
